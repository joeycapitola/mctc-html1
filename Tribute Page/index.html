          <h2>A Tale of Two Silly Dogs</h2>

          <p id="tribute-info">
            Molly and Jasper are two silly little dogs who are so sweet and sleepy. They love to eat snacks and wrestle.</p><p> My partner and I adopted Molly in the spring of 2019. She was just under two years old, but had been rehomed multiple times. Because of this, she had an extreme case of separation anxiety and had to go with us everywhere. She's a great patio buddy, and loves kids and puppies. She'll act aloof so that no one knows how bad she wants to hang out.
            </p>
            <p>We got Jasper through our local animal control a couple years ago. He's a manic boy who's always on alert. ball is life for him, and he'll run so hard he'll run his pawpads raw. Poor buddy. In contrast to Molly's "too cool" demeanor, Jasper is a dorky little velcro dog.</p>
            So many good dogs need homes! <a
